## About
This is a remake of the [Firebase Web Codelab](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web#0) using React and TypeScript. It's just for practice.

It primarily follows the [Firebase Chat with React in 7 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQyrwxMPm88) YouTube tutorial by Fireship ([Tutorial Repo](https://github.com/fireship-io/react-firebase-chat)) but updated to use the v9 Firebase API.


## Design Inspiration:
- [Godcast - A Podcast Mobile App on Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/126028573/Godcast-A-Podcast-Mobile-App?tracking_source=search_projects) for colors
- [Chatla - Chat Messenger App on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1108257769165957583) for overall
